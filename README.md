# FindYourHat
Project for Codecademy

This interactive terminal game was build with JavaScript Classes. You can read the code on my GitHub page and play it in node.js. Find your hat, but beware of the holes!

## Idea
This game was made as a ‘challenge project’ for the front-end engineer path of Codecademy. The assignment was to build an interactive terminal game with JavaScript classes and using user input in Node.js.

## Approach
The player sees a field with a few holes and one hat. The goal is to find your hat using your keyboard.

## Challenges
This whole assignment was pretty challenging as it was the first time the assignment only included functionalities and I had to come up with the necessary functions and how they would interact by myself. Once I had the game working the last challenge was to ensure that the console would not reprint the whole field every time you made a move. With the help of some co-students at the Codecademy forum I added code to ensure the player would keep seeing the same field with only his/her move updated.

## Room to improve
This game can be made more exiting by adding more rows and columns. I would also like to make it possible to play this game online. Therefore, I would like to rebuild this game using React to ensure the field would not have to be reloaded after each move.
